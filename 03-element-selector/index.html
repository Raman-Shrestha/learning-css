        Good life is a life with purpose. It is a life where you make the most of everything in any kind of situation, be it good or bad, where in the toughest of times you stay calm, collected and are able to perceiver through. It is a life journeyed through with family, friends and other loved ones. It is one where you don't regret the decisions you make and do not think about what it would have been had you done something differently, i.e. it is a life without any ‘what ifs’. To be loved and to be able to love is a crucial part of having a good life. A good life is something that everyone wants to have or achieve without really realizing that they might already have one. Through this essay I want to show people that the ‘good’ aspect in good life can be something so small that it is often overlooked but can make your life that much better. It is the small things that make life good rather than the large extravagant ones.

            When some people talk about money
            They speak as if it were a mysterious lover
            Who went out to buy milk and never
            Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
            For the years I lived on coffee and bread,
            Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday
            Like a woman journeying for water
            From a village without a well, then living
            One or two nights like everyone else
            On roast chicken and red wine.
